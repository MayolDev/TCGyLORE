## 2025-05-23 - [Missing PHP Environment]
**Learning:** This environment is missing the PHP runtime, despite being a Laravel project.
**Action:** When identifying performance improvements, I must focus on static analysis and safe refactoring that doesn't rely on runtime verification (like running tests) if the environment is restricted. I will double-check my assumptions by manual code tracing.
